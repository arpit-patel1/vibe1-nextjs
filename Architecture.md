## Component Architecture

We'll follow a component-based architecture with the following structure:

### Core Components

1. **ActivityCard** - Container for each learning activity
2. **FeedbackDisplay** - Shows AI-generated results and encouragement
3. **ProgressTracker** - Visual representation of advancement
4. **SubjectNavigator** - Navigation between subject areas
5. **CharacterGuide** - AI-powered animated character to assist children
6. **AudioController** - Manages sound effects and narration
7. **AchievementSystem** - Badges and rewards management
8. **AIModelSelector** - UI for selecting OpenAI models
9. **APIKeyInput** - Secure input for OpenAI API key
10. **AIStatusIndicator** - Shows AI connection and processing status

### Page Structure

1. **Home** - Main landing with subject selection
2. **SubjectHub** - Overview of activities for a subject
3. **ActivityPlayer** - Container for AI-generated activities
4. **AchievementGallery** - Display of earned rewards
5. **SettingsPanel** - AI configuration, API key management, and preferences
6. **AITutorChat** - Optional direct interaction with AI tutor

## State Management

Given the AI-native nature of the application, we'll use a combination of React Context, localStorage, and secure API routes:

### Context Providers

1. **UserProgressContext** - Tracks completion and achievements
2. **PreferencesContext** - Stores UI preferences and settings
3. **ActivityContext** - Manages current activity state
4. **AudioContext** - Controls sound settings and playback
5. **AIContext** - Manages AI configuration, model selection, and API key

### Data Storage Schema

```typescript
// User Progress Schema
interface UserProgress {
  completedActivities: {
    [activityId: string]: {
      completedAt: number;
      score: number;
      attempts: number;
      aiRecommendations: string[];
    }
  };
  achievements: string[];
  currentLevel: {
    math: number;
    english: number;
    leadership: number;
  };
  lastVisited: string;
  learningStyle: string;
  interests: string[];
  challengeAreas: string[];
}

// Preferences Schema
interface Preferences {
  audio: {
    sfxVolume: number;
    narrationVolume: number;
    musicVolume: number;
  };
  accessibility: {
    highContrast: boolean;
    largeText: boolean;
    reducedMotion: boolean;
  };
  character: {
    selectedCharacter: string;
    customizations: Record<string, string>;
  };
  ai: {
    selectedModel: string;
    apiKey: string; // Stored securely
    responseSpeed: 'fast' | 'medium' | 'thorough';
    difficultyAdjustment: boolean;
    contentPersonalization: boolean;
  };
}
```

## AI Integration Architecture

### API Key Management
- Secure storage of API keys using HttpOnly cookies
- Option for session-only API key usage
- Environment variables for default API key (optional)

### Model Selection
- Default: GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective operation
- Options: GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and other OpenAI models
- Model capabilities explained in child-friendly terms
- Automatic fallback to simpler models if needed

### AI Content Generation

1. **Question Generation**
   - Dynamic creation of math problems based on skill level
   - English grammar and vocabulary questions tailored to user
   - Leadership scenarios personalized to interests

2. **Answer Evaluation**
   - Real-time assessment of free-text answers
   - Detailed feedback on incorrect answers
   - Identification of misconceptions and learning patterns

3. **Personalized Learning**
   - Analysis of user performance to identify strengths/weaknesses
   - Adaptive difficulty based on success rate
   - Content tailored to detected learning style and interests

4. **AI Tutor Interaction**
   - Character-based AI guide with age-appropriate personality
   - Contextual hints when user is struggling
   - Celebratory responses for achievements

### API Request Flow

```
User Interaction → Client Component → AIContext → 
Next.js API Route → OpenAI API → 
Response Processing → State Update → UI Rendering
```

## Activity Content Management

Activities will be dynamically generated using AI:

```typescript
interface AIGeneratedActivity {
  id: string;
  type: 'multiple-choice' | 'drag-drop' | 'fill-blank' | 'matching' | 'tracing';
  subject: 'math' | 'english' | 'leadership';
  difficulty: 1 | 2 | 3;
  title: string;
  instructions: {
    text: string;
    audio: string;
  };
  content: any; // Generated by AI based on type
  feedback: {
    correct: string[];
    incorrect: string[];
    hints: string[];
  };
  aiMetadata: {
    generatedBy: string; // Model name
    learningObjectives: string[];
    conceptsCovered: string[];
    recommendedFollowUp: string[];
  };
}
```

This structure allows for:
- Dynamic generation of unlimited activities
- Progressive difficulty paths
- Subject-specific content
- Different interaction types
- Personalized learning experiences

## Performance Considerations

### AI Optimization
- Client-side caching of AI responses
- Batched API requests to reduce costs
- Streaming responses for long-form content
- Fallback to pre-generated content when offline

### Code Splitting
- Each subject area loads independently
- Activity types are dynamically imported
- Route-based code splitting with Next.js

### Asset Optimization
- SVG for UI elements where possible
- Compressed audio files with fallbacks
- Lazy-loaded images and illustrations
- Font subsetting for custom typefaces

### Caching Strategy
- Service worker for offline capabilities
- Cache essential assets on first visit
- Versioned assets for easy updates

## Accessibility Features

### Implementation Approach
- ARIA attributes throughout components
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly content
- Color contrast compliance
- Reduced motion options
- Text-to-speech for instructions
- AI-generated simplified content for different needs

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Jest for utility functions
- React Testing Library for components
- Mock AI responses for consistent testing

### User Testing
- Simplicity tests with target age group
- Parent/teacher feedback integration
- Engagement metrics collection (optional)
- AI response quality evaluation

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. TypeScript compilation
2. Tailwind CSS purging
3. Next.js production build
4. Environment variable configuration for AI services

### Hosting
- Vercel for production deployment
- GitHub Pages as alternative (with API proxying)
- Any static hosting would work with separate API handling

## Future Technical Considerations

1. **PWA Implementation** - For offline use and installation
2. **Content Expansion** - AI-generated content for new subjects
3. **Internationalization** - AI-powered translation and localization
4. **Print Functionality** - Generate printable worksheets
5. **Parent Dashboard** - AI insights on child's learning patterns
6. **Voice Interaction** - Speech recognition for answers
7. **Multi-modal Learning** - Image and audio-based AI interactions

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup** - Clone repository and install dependencies
2. **Environment** - Configure OpenAI API keys
3. **Development** - Run local server with hot reloading
4. **Testing** - Verify AI integrations with sample queries
5. **Deployment** - Build and deploy with secure environment variables

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Export static site
npm run export
```

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a child-friendly educational application that runs entirely in the browser without backend dependencies. The technology choices prioritize performance, maintainability, and a great user experience for young learners.
