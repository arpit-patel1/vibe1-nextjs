# Character Images for KidSkills

This directory contains SVG images for the character guide used in the KidSkills application.

## Character Emotions

Each character has multiple emotion states:

1. **happy** - The default positive state
2. **excited** - Used for celebrations and achievements
3. **thinking** - Used when presenting problems or questions
4. **confused** - Used when the child makes a mistake or needs help

## File Naming Convention

Character images follow this naming pattern:
`[character-name]-[emotion].svg`

For example:
- `default-happy.svg`
- `default-excited.svg`
- `default-thinking.svg`
- `default-confused.svg`

## Adding New Characters

To add a new character:

1. Create SVG files for all four emotions
2. Follow the naming convention: `[character-name]-[emotion].svg`
3. Ensure the SVG has a viewBox of "0 0 200 200" for consistent sizing
4. Keep the file size small (under 10KB if possible)
5. Use simple, child-friendly designs with clear emotions

## Character Selection

Characters can be selected through the preferences system in the application. The default character is used if no specific character is selected.
