# Audio Files for KidSkills

This directory contains placeholder files for the audio used in the KidSkills application. 
For a complete experience, replace these placeholder files with actual audio files.

## Required Audio Files

1. **button-click.mp3** - A short click sound for button interactions
2. **navigation.mp3** - A sound for navigation between pages
3. **card-select.mp3** - A sound for selecting activity cards

## Audio Guidelines

- Keep audio files short and lightweight (under 100KB if possible)
- Use child-friendly sounds that are not too loud or jarring
- Ensure sounds are distinct enough to provide clear feedback
- Consider accessibility by making sounds optional through the preferences system

## Adding New Audio

When adding new audio files, make sure to:
1. Use the MP3 format for broad compatibility
2. Update the audio references in the code if using different filenames
3. Test the audio on different devices to ensure consistent volume levels
